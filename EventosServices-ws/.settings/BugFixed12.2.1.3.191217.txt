1 Zero Downtime Patching
------------------------------
This patch has been marked as eligible for Zero Downtime Patching. 
The type of Zero Downtime Patching supported by this patch is FMW_ROLLING_ORACLE_HOME.

With Zero Downtime Patching, a Patch can be applied to a system in a manner
that does not incur any downtime. This ensures that the system can remain
available and functioning during the patching process. Certain
pre-requisites, however, must be met before the patch can be applied.

For more information, see the following:
Doc ID 1942159.1 Introduction to Zero Downtime (ZDT) Patching for Oracle Fusion Middleware / WebLogic Server 
https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1942159.1

 

2 Prerequisites
----------------
Ensure that you meet the following requirements before you install or
deinstall the patch:

1. Understand the PSU program:

Review the following before applying PSUs for the first time:

Doc ID 1306505.1 Patch Set Update (PSU) Administration Guide for Oracle 
WebLogic Server (WLS)
https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1306505.1


2. Update Java SE (JDK/JRE):

For users of Oracle JDKs and JVMs, we strongly recommend applying the latest
Java Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) as soon as they are released. Refer to the
following for further information:

Doc ID 1506916.1 Obtaining Java SE (JDK/JRE) for Oracle Fusion Middleware Products
https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1506916.1


3. Update OPatch:

Oracle Fusion Middleware 12.2.1 products are installed with OPatch NextGen 13.3
to apply interim patches. The OPatch utility should be updated over time to 
resolve known issues.

You can check your version using the following command:

   ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch version

*** To install this PSU, you must use OPatch version 13.9.4.2 or later

If you try to install the PSU with an earlier opatch version (e.g. 13.9.2.0.0),
you will see an error similar to:

   "
   Verifying environment and performing prerequisite checks...
   Prerequisite check "CheckMinimumOPatchVersion" failed.
   The details are:

   The OPatch being used has version 13.9.2.0.0 while the following patch(es)
   require higher versions:
   Patch 30675853 requires OPatch version 13.9.4.2.0 or later.
   Please download latest OPatch from My Oracle Support.
   "

*** OPatch 13.9.4 is available as Patch 28186730:
https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=patch&id=28186730

Review the following for more OPatch information:

Doc ID 1587524.1 Using OUI NextGen OPatch 13 for Oracle Fusion Middleware 12c (12.1.2+)
https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1587524.1


4. Verify the OUI Inventory.
OPatch needs access to a valid OUI inventory to apply patches.

Note: This needs the ORACLE_HOME to be set(refer section "2. Pre-Installation Instructions")
prior to run the below commands:

Validate the OUI inventory with the following commands:

$ opatch lsinventory -jre $ORACLE_HOME/oracle_common/jdk/jre

Note:
Make sure the JDK version you use is the certified version for your product.

If the command errors out, contact Oracle Support and work to validate
and verify the inventory setup before proceeding.


5. Create a location for storing the unzipped patch: 

This location will be referred to later in the document as PATCH_TOP.

NOTE: On WINDOWS, the preferred location is the drive root directory.
For example, "C:\PATCH_TOP" and avoid choosing locations like,
"C:\Documents and Settings\username\PATCH_TOP".
This is necessary due to the 256 characters limitation on windows
platform.

3 Pre-Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

1. Set the ORACLE_HOME environment variable to the directory where you have installed ORACLE WEBLOGIC SERVER.

2. To install this PSU, you must use OPatch version 13.9.4. See Prerequisite section above.



4 Installation Instructions
---------------------------

1. Unzip the patch zip file into the PATCH_TOP.

$ unzip -d PATCH_TOP p30675853_122130_Generic.zip

NOTE: On WINDOWS, the unzip command has a limitation of 256 characters in the path name.
If you encounter this, please use an alternate ZIP utility like 7-Zip to unzip the patch.

For example: To unzip using 7-zip, run the command:
"c:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" x  p30675853_122130_Generic.zip

2. Set your current directory to the directory where the patch is located.

$ cd PATCH_TOP/30675853

3. Run OPatch to apply the patch.

$ opatch apply

Windows:
When applying interim patches with OPatch 13.9.4, Microsoft Windows platform needs the '-oop' option:

   <ORACLE_HOME>\OPatch\opatch apply <PATCH_HOME> -oop

where PATCH_HOME is a numbered directory where you extracted interim patch contents.

Note:
-----
When OPatch starts, it validates the patch and makes sure that there are no
conflicts with the software already installed in the ORACLE_HOME.

In case of opatch conflict, you will see a warning message similar to the one mentioned below:

Interim Patch XXXX has Conflict with patch(es) [ YYYY ] in OH ...
Conflict patches: YYYY
Patch(es) YYYY conflict with the patch currently being installed (XXXX).
If you continue, patch(es) YYYY will be rolled back and the new patch (XXXX) will be installed.

If a merge of the new patch (XXXX) and the conflicting patch(es) ( YYYY) is required,contact Oracle Support Services and request a Merged patch.

Do you want to proceed? [y|n]
n

You must stop the patch installation and the following should be reviewed:

Doc ID 1329952.1 Oracle Fusion Middleware Patch Conflict Resolution
https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1329952.1

Contact Oracle Support if the conflict cannot be resolved or you need a Merge Request.

5 Post-Installation Instructions
---------------------------------

Note:   The fix for bug 26929163 updates the runtime components for the 
WLS plugin for the RCU and Upgrade Assistant tools.  It will prevent any 
future WLS schema installs or upgrades from allowing WLS schema owners to 
retain ANY privs once installation or upgrade have been completed.  The 
patch will *not* affect schemas that have already been installed or 
upgraded to the correct schema version.

For existing installations that wish to remove the ANY privileges that 
have been assigned to the WLS schema owners, users can run the script 
located at $MW_HOME/oracle_common/common/sql/wlsservices/sql/cleanup.sql
as the DBA user and provide the WLS schema owner names.  For example, if 
the WLS schema owners are DEV1_WLS and DEV1_WLS_RUNTIME:

      sqlplus <dba-connect-info> cleanup.sql  DEV1_WLS  DEV1_WLS_RUNTIME


6 Deinstallation Instructions
------------------------------

If you experience any problems after installing this patch, remove the patch as
follows:

1. Make sure to follow the same Prerequisites or pre-install steps (if any)
when deinstalling a patch.
This includes setting up any environment variables like ORACLE_HOME and
verifying the OUI inventory before deinstalling.

2. Change to the directory where the patch was unzipped.

$ cd PATCH_TOP/30675853

3. Run OPatch to deinstall the patch.

$ opatch rollback -id  30675853

7 Post Deinstallation Instructions
-----------------------------------
Restart all servers (AdminServer and all Managed server(s)).

This is necessary to redeploy the original applications and bring the
environment back to it's original state.

DISCLAIMER:


Oracle recommends this Patch Set Update (PSU) for development and production
systems in accordance with Doc ID 1306505.1.

This PSU may conflict with an interim patch(es) that has been applied to
customer systems. If a patch conflict is identified, customers should
determine, through review of the bugs fixed list, whether the interim patch
was included in the PSU.   If the interim patch is included in the PSU, the
interim patch does not need to be applied to systems where the PSU is
applied.    If the interim patch is not included in the PSU, the conflict
probably arises because the PSU modifies the same module as the interim
patch.   In such cases, customers should contact Oracle Support, provide
information about all patches applied to the system, and request an overlay
patch(es) that will resolve the conflict.
